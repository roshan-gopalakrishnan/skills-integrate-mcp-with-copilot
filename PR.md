chore(docs): DB persistence docs and Alembic guidance

Updated `src/README.md`, added `ALEMBIC_README.md` with instructions, added `CHANGES.md`, and updated `requirements.txt` to include `alembic` and `pytest` for local developer workflows.

This PR follows up on PR #17 that implemented SQLite persistence using SQLAlchemy.
