This PR improves documentation and adds migration guidance for the DB-backed storage introduced earlier (PR #17). It adds `ALEMBIC_README.md`, updates `src/README.md` to document DB run steps, adds `CHANGES.md`, and includes `alembic` and `pytest` as dev dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

Follow-up items: add generated Alembic environment and migrations; add a basic test suite.
