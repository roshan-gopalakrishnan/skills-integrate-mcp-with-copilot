chore(docs): DB persistence docs and Alembic guidance

This PR updates documentation to reflect DB-backed storage and provides migration guidance for alembic.

Related to PR #17 which added SQLAlchemy models and endpoints (SQLite default).

Next steps: add generated Alembic config and migrations if we want migrations included.
