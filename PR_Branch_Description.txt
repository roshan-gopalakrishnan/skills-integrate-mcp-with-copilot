This PR updates the docs to reflect the DB-backed storage and provides steps to set up Alembic migrations and local testing with pytest. It complements PR #17 which added SQLAlchemy persistence.

Files changed:
- `src/README.md` — documents DB-backed storage and run instructions
- `ALEMBIC_README.md` — instructions to set up Alembic and run migrations locally
- `CHANGES.md` — summarized changes
- `requirements.txt` — adds `alembic` and `pytest` to dev deps

Follow-up:
- Optionally add real Alembic directory and migrations and add a `make migration` helper
