chore(docs): DB persistence docs and Alembic guidance

This PR updates documentation and adds migration guidance for the DB-backed storage introduced earlier in PR #17.

- Updates `src/README.md` to reflect the database-backed setup and running steps
- Adds `ALEMBIC_README.md` with instructions to set up Alembic migrations
- Adds `CHANGES.md` to record follow-up items
- Adds `alembic` and `pytest` to `requirements.txt`

This is a small follow-up PR to improve onboarding and development experience.
