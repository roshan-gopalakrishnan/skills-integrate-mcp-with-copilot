chore(docs): DB persistence docs and Alembic guidance

This PR updates the documentation to reflect DB-backed storage and provides instructions for adding Alembic migrations.

Follow-up items (for a subsequent PR):
- Add generated Alembic environment and migrations (if desired)
- Add example `docker-compose.yml` with Postgres for production testing
